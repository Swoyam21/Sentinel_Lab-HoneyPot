<h1>Geo-Location Enrichment and Visualization (SIEM)</h1>





<h2>Description</h2>

The honeypot lab is a controlled environment designed to simulate vulnerable systems, enticing malicious actors to interact with them, thereby gathering valuable intelligence on cyber threats and attack methodologies. Leveraging Azure infrastructure and PowerShell automation, this lab deploys and manages honeypot instances, while integrating IPGeolocation API for pinpointing the geographical origins of malicious activities. By providing insights into emerging cyber threats, this lab enhances cybersecurity defenses and fosters proactive threat mitigation strategies.

<h2>Quick Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>Virtual Machine Setup</h3>
- I created a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure, naming it "HoneyPot-VirtualMachine" and placing it in the "HoneyPotLab" resource group. The VM was located in the "East US" region.
The VM used the "Windows 10 Pro" image with the "Standard_B1s" size (1 vCPU, 1GiB memory).<br />
- I configured RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) access to the VM, making it publicly discoverable.<br />

<h3>Log Analytics Workspace (LAW) Configuration</h3>
- I created a Log Analytics Workspace named "LAWHoneyPot" in the "HoneyPotLab" resource group to collect and store log data.<br />
- I enabled log data collection from the VM to the LAW by configuring data collection settings in the Security Center.<br />
- I connected the VM to the LAW to send log data from the VM's event viewer to the workspace.<br />

<h3>Custom Log Exporter</h3>
- I developed a custom PowerShell script that extracted failed login attempts from the VM's event logs and retrieved the corresponding IP addresses.<br />
- Using the IPGeolocation API, I obtained geographic information based on the IP addresses and exported the data to a log file in the VM's "C:\ProgramData" directory.<br />

<h3>Custom Log in Log Analytics Workspace</h3>
- In the LAW, I created a custom log table named "FAILED_RDP_GEO_CL" to store the geographic data obtained from the PowerShell script.<br />
- I uploaded a sample log file generated by the script to validate the custom log format.<br />

<h3>Setting up a Map in Microsoft Sentinel</h3>
- I accessed Microsoft Sentinel from the Azure portal and created a new workbook named "Failed RDP World Map."<br />
- I wrote a query in the workbook to extract relevant columns, including timestamp, country, state, username, destination, longitude, and latitude.<br />
- I configured the visualization option to display the data on a world map, plotting the latitude and longitude data and labeling it by country.<br />

<h3>Monitoring Attack Data</h3>
- After starting the PowerShell script, the custom log exporter collected and uploaded failed login attempts and geolocation data to the Log Analytics Workspace.<br />
- Microsoft Sentinel continuously analyzed the data and displayed real-time information on the world map in the "Failed RDP World Map" workbook.<br />

<h2>Language, Platforms and Tools Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell:</b> Extract RDP failed logon logs from Windows Event Viewer
- <b>Azure:</b> Utilized for hosting and managing the infrastructure supporting the honeypot lab, facilitating scalable deployment and effective monitoring of malicious activities.
- <b>IPGeolocation API:</b> Used to integrate into honeypot lab to automatically retrieve and analyze geolocation dataof incoming attempts, enhancing the understanding of the geographic origins of potential threats within the lab enviornment.
- <b>Microsoft Sentinel:</b> The honeypot lab integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Sentinel, enhancing threat detection and response capabilities by correlating honeypot-generated data with other security telemetry within the Azure enviornment.
